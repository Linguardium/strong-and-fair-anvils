# Strong and Fair Anvils
Modifies anvils to:
- not randomly degrade from using them (though they can still degrade from falling)
- not increase the prior work penalty (but respect previous value)
- not cost experience levels for repairing and renaming items

Also adds a Stone Anvil that can only perform operations that do not cost experience levels (renaming and repair).

Uses FABRIC modloader.
